It's pretty common to keep getting newer ideas or an annoying bug that you need to fix later.\
So you'd want to write them down somewhere.\
What better way to do that than to use **Sticky Notes** right?! \
Now you don't need to maintain them externally, with <big>**VSSticky**</big>, you can attach sticky notes from within VSCode!

## Why VSSticky? üìù
There are tons of sticky notes extensions out there, but what makes <big>**VSSticky**</big> different?\
<big>**VSSticky**</big> is a first of a kind extension that offers isolated sticky notes.\
You can have `seperate sticky notes for every file`.
> You can focus better on the task at hand.\
> No more the need for scavenging through a bunch of sticky notes to find the one that you had planned for a particular file.
